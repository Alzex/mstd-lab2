## Conclusion
Unit tests are very useful for testing the code. 
They help to find bugs and errors in the code. 
They also help to make the code more reliable and stable. 
It's very useful for large projects with a lot of code and commercial projects. It helps to save time and money. Without unit tests, it's more difficult to find errors in the code.
